# Face Mask Detection System

This project is a face mask detection system that uses computer vision techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time. The system utilizes deep learning models for image classification and can be deployed on both local machines and embedded systems.

## Features

- Real-time face mask detection using a webcam or video stream
  
- High accuracy in detecting face masks
  
- User-friendly interface for visualizing detection results
  
- Scalable and suitable for deployment on various platforms


## Usage

1. **Starting the application:**

    - Run `detect_mask.py` to start the face mask detection system.

2. **Using the system:**

    - Position a webcam or video source to detect faces in real-time.
    - The system will overlay annotations indicating whether a detected face is wearing a mask or not.
